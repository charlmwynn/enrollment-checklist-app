      <h2>How to Apply</h2>
      <p>
        Complete the <strong>Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA)</strong> to be automatically considered
        for federal, state, and Lasell University need-based aid.  
        Lasell University's FAFSA Code: <strong>002158</strong>.  
      </p>
      <p>
        Our <em>priority FAFSA deadline</em> is <strong>March 31</strong>. Submitting after this date may reduce
        eligibility for some aid programs. For Massachusetts residents, the FAFSA must be submitted by May 1
        to be considered for the Mass Grant.
